Milestone 4 / PPM-Viewer Refelction

This project was fairly simple, once you understood what you were supposed to add to effect factor and ppmviewer
hpp's then the rest was just adjusting your code so it would work correctly with the Pixel class. I did not 
start this milestone until after Thanksgiving break was over, but that first day back I finished all 
the code. Honestly, this really showed me how efficient a class makes writing the code. If I had implemented a 
class earlier into the project, a lot of unneccessary stress could have been avoided. It makes manipulating the
images so much easier.

Getting this milestone done the first week back gave me a lot of time to study for the final programming exam,
which was difficult but not as hard as I originally thought. The one that really got me was the deleting the node
from the linked list. I thought I had all the code down and going into it I was fairly confident in my ability to
get it done. However, the first question tripped me up because it kept throwing an exception that I was not 
expecting. So, I finish the rest of the problems and then come back to that one and use the debugger to figure 
out what was going on. I narrowed it down to once it got to the value it was supposed to delete, instead of 
exiting the while loop like I thought it would, it would end up being this really big negative number and throw
an exception. It was changing the value of that node, but I am still unsure as to why.

Overall, this whole experience with the PPM manipulation throughout the semester was very gratifying. I learned 
so much about C++, myself, and the coding process in general; I thoroughly enjoyed this course.
